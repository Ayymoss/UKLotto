Lotto Understanding: 
45,000,000 enter
6 Numbers from 1-59 & 7 Lines 
	Max 10 slips
6 Main Numbers Accurate = Jackpot
5 Main Numbers + Bonus Ball = £1,000,000
5 Main Numbers = £1,750
4 Main Numbers = £140
3 Main Numbers = £30
2 Main Numbers = Free Lucky Dip

If no jackpot winner, it rolls over each time until 4 roll overs
5th one is shared between 5 bonus winners

Formula: Range!/((Range-Count)!*Count!) ( 59!/(53!*6!) )

Lotto Bonus: 
Match 5 + Bonus = £1m
Bonus ball is given to you - used ONLY if you have 5 match. 
	6th UMATCHED main lotto number, IF matched Bonus THEN £1m payout
		As 5 MAIN + 1 BONUS (=YOUR 6 PICKS)

Lucky Dip Understanding: 
Same as main game in same draw with automated picking. 

For purposes of this idea, I will make everything "Lucky Dip".
